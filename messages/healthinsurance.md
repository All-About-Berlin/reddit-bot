Welcome to /r/berlin! It looks like you're asking about German health insurance.

There is [an introduction to health insurance in Germany](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/german-health-insurance) that should answer most of your questions. It explains the differences between public and private health insurance, and which one is better for you.

[/r/germany](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/) has a lot more experience with health insurance issues. Make sure you ask them too.

You can also ask a health insurance broker. Their services are free. They get paid by the insurance companies when you sign an insurance contract. Make sure you pick an independent broker.
